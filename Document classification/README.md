## Project Overview
The project focuses on building a text classification system using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It includes:
- Preprocessing and cleaning text data.
- Transforming text into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF.
- Training a Naive Bayes classifier for categorizing text.
- Evaluating the model with performance metrics and visualizations.

### Objectives
- Demonstrate the application of Naive Bayes in text classification.
- Highlight the importance of preprocessing and feature engineering in NLP tasks.
- Provide a modular and reproducible codebase for beginners and practitioners.
